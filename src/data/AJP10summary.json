      "1. UNDERSTAND: Before you can communicate effectively, you need to understand your audience. Key questions: Who are we trying to reach? What do they currently believe? How do they get their information? What will change their minds? This is called Information Environment Assessment (IEA)—basically research to understand how information flows and affects people.",
      "2. PLAN & INTEGRATE: Once you understand the audience, plan activities that will influence them. This means: Making sure your words match your actions (no \"say-do gap\"), Coordinating across all military units, Thinking about how audiences will interpret everything you do, Planning for unintended consequences.",
      "3. COMMUNICATE: Execute your communications plan using the right tools. NATO uses three main capabilities: Military Public Affairs, Information Operations, and Psychological Operations."

      { "term": "FACT-CHECK", "def": "Publish evidence proving the false claim is wrong. Works best when you have clear proof and can respond quickly, especially with audiences who trust evidence. Limitation: The lie often spreads faster than the correction." },
      { "term": "PRE-BUNK (Inoculation)", "def": "Warn audiences *before* disinformation appears about manipulation tactics they might see. Best for building long-term resilience, like a vaccine. Limitation: Requires preparation; you can't prebunk something that already happened." },
      { "term": "IGNORE", "def": "Don't respond; don't give the false claim attention. Rarely works, as silence often looks like guilt. Limitation: Adversaries will claim you can't deny it because it's true." },
      { "term": "COUNTER-NARRATIVE", "def": "Tell a different, positive story that shifts attention away from the false claim. Works when you have compelling true stories to tell. Limitation: Requires authentic positive content to share." },
      { "term": "DISCREDIT SOURCE", "def": "Attack the credibility of whoever is spreading the disinformation. Works when you can prove the source has ties to hostile actors or a history of lies. Limitation: Can backfire badly and make you look defensive." }
